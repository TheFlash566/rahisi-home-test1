This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Installing Node.js and npm
Before setting up this Next.js, I ensured that Node.js and npm are installed on your machine. You can install the latest version of Node.js on the official Node.js website: https://nodejs.org/en/download/.

## Creating new Next.js project
After installing the Node.js and npm, i used this command: " npx create-next-app@latest --ts " on my terminal to create a new Next.js app.

## Running development server
After creating the new Next.js app and followed all the neccessary instructions, i ran this command: " npm run dev " on my terminal to start the development server.

## Installing Chakra UI
To install Chakra UI, you can run this command on your terminal: " npm i @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion "

## Provider setup
After installing Chakra UI, you need to set up the ChakraProvider at the root of your application.

Go to pages/_app.js or pages/_app.tsx (create it if it doesn't exist) and wrap the Component with the ChakraProvider:
